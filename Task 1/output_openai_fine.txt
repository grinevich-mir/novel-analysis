"Pancakes! Pancakes!" (Max and Nell, excited)
"With raisins? I hate raisins." (Mary, displeased)
“A glass of scotch for me” said the boy with a pretend confidence. Joe clearly saw that the boy was scared but his eyes were lightened up with determination and will. (Boy, scared/pretend confident; Joe, observant)
“Sit down little boy, and have some hot tea. I bet you can’t pay for scotch anyway” said Joe pushing a cup of hot sweet tea over the counter. The boy took a long sip, another one, his shivering started fading away and his teeth stopped chattering. (Joe, welcoming/doubtful; Boy, relieved)
“I bet, you can’t pay for that tea as well”.
“I will pay for it as soon as I get a job, I will be an avatar driver.” Joe was clearly frustrated. “Oh boy, one more of those.”, he thought. “Go home to your mommy, and don’t show up here anymore. This is not a place for a 7 year old kid”, said Joe, “I don’t have either time or desire to deal with you”. (Joe, frustrated/impatient)
“I need a job”, answered the boy, “I won’t leave unless you give me the job. And I am 10 already, I am not a boy anymore.”
Oh yeah, being ten makes you a man, not under my watch, thought Joe. The only thought he had was how to get rid of this boy and get back to his job. He had to serve some drinks, check on the pods in the basement. He had work to do. “Ok, I’ll give you a test, and if you fail it, you will never show up at my bar again.” Joe took a square wood plank from the shelf and held it out for the child to grab. “Break it with your hand”. (Joe, annoyed/calculating; Boy, determined/cautious)
He didn’t move, with eyes focused on Joe He asked “I break this plank and I get a job?”. The kid was smart & cautious, maybe he will survive in this messed up world, though Joe. “Yes, you break it with your bare hands and you will get a job”. A little show for the patrons won’t hurt, and Joe will finally get rid of this boy when he fails the test. (Joe, calculating/expectant; Boy, cautious)
That board made a cracking sound… and didn’t break. Joe turned and started walking towards the bar, people started walking back to their tables, the boy looked shocked on his hands with damaged skin, drops of blood were forming on his knuckles, rolling down his fingers, and falling on the floor. Joe walked over the bar and turned to the boy to tell him to go home when he noticed that his finger curled back into a fist, and he hit the plank again, forcefully breathing out the air of his lungs. He hit again, and again, and again, until the wood couldn’t resist the force and broke into two pieces. (Boy, determined/shocked; Joe, surprised/relieved)
"You told me to break it, you didn’t tell me I can only hit it once. I have the job. Deal is a deal." (Boy, determined)
"Hey Joe. What the hell are you doing? This boy is what, 10 years old? And you will offer him a job? In the old world you would go straight to jail for this." (Swen, irritated)
"Shut your fucking mouth, Swen, and open your god damn eyes! This boy didn’t eat well for a month! He doesn’t have money. Will you feed him? Are you ready to buy him food and clothes and support him till he gets 14? Or do you think I should feed him? Or maybe you think I just should let him die? No? I don’t hear a fucking answer! You don’t have one? Then shut the fuck up and get lost." (Joe, angry)
"The Job is yours, Kid. But if you will fuck it up today, you will lose your chance. Let’s go and I will show you your pod for the day." (Joe, determined)
“Old time habits, Kid. Always scared that some party pooper will show up and we will need to stop our little business here.” (Joe, casual)
"That’s Mike, he is the top Overworld player in this shithole that I run, he even has a contract with some clan or something. But enough of it, the shift will start in 10 minutes, and we need to set up your pod." (Joe, casual)
"Nah, it has enough safeguards, I heard about one or two cases tops, but haven’t seen anyone with my own eye yet. So it may be all just blabber." (Joe, casual)
"Ha, ha,... the size for you? It will take me at least couple days to adjust the size for you, and then back to another driver, I will lose 4 days of rental money. Will you pay for that? I doubt it. Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mi..." (Joe, amused)
"Ha, ha,... the size for you? It will take me at least couple days to adjust the size for you, and then back to another driver, I will lose 4 days of rental money. Will you pay for that? I doubt it. Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mike pays for. I doubt you will ever have money for this. And don’t fucking dare to mess up the work today. You owe me the rent for today, if you won’t get paid for your job, You will be fucking cleaning the floor in the bar with you damn cocky tongue for month." (Joe, angry)
"Don’t fuck it up kid, remember? Don’t fuck it up." (Joe, warning)
