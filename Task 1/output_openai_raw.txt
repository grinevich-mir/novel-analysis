"﻿I suddenly opened my eyes." (Narrator, neutral)
"She’s just two years older than me, but not much taller, maybe one or two inches, just a tiny bit, and yet she already took over the caretakers’ responsibilities, who left us around two months ago." (Narrator, neutral)
"But me, I was so useless." (Narrator, sad)
"I couldn’t help her much, and truly speaking, I was not interested." (Narrator, sad)
"Our kids loved pancakes - especially Nell and Max, our youngest ones." (Narrator, nostalgic)
"Pancakes! Pancakes!" (Max and Nell, excited)
"With raisins? I hate raisins." (Mary, displeased)
"What will we be eating a week from now?" (Narrator, worried)
"I researched my options during the week by asking around and listening to what people were talking about in Grog’s market, a grocery store on the corner, one block away from the orphanage." (Narrator, determined)
"My path to Joe’s could take as much as a couple of hours, and the path over the hills would be tough." (Narrator, determined)
"The path through the city was so rough that my jacket and hoodie didn’t save me from the weather." (Narrator, determined)
"But not today, tomorrow. Today I will get the job." (Narrator, determined)
"Thankfully some parts of the city survived and even stayed connected to the System and the network via the low orbit satellites. Luckily for some of us there is still a place in the world that is intact, a country that had managed to lock its borders fast enough. We call that place Eden, and every single miserable human in the shattered world doesn't even dare to dream about living there." (Narrator, neutral)
"I shook my head to get rid of all those memories that flooded my mind. Focus. I need to focus on my goal. Joe’s bar should be somewhere close-by right around the corner, the path here took me a bit more time then I had expected and the sky was starting to be painted yellow in the East. But the Joe’s bar sign was still lightened up and bright enough so it was hard to miss it." (Narrator, determined)
"It was early morning but Joe was up, he actually hadn't gone to bed yet, the night shifters just got out of their pods and some of them were having a drink at the bar, and the day shift should be coming in an hour or so. The door banged and a young boy entered the bar, he looked like he was 7 or 8, skinny, way too skinny for a boy or for any human being. It looked like he didn’t eat well lately. His clothes and shoes were all wet and the water dripping from him was making puddles on the floor. The kid was shivering from the cold, and his teeths were chattering loud enough that anyone in the bar could hear it. All heads turned towards him, it was definitely not an ordinary occasion to see someone like that at Joe’s and people were expecting a show." (Narrator, neutral)
“A glass of scotch for me” said the boy with a pretend confidence. Joe clearly saw that the boy was scared but his eyes were lightened up with determination and will. (Boy, scared/pretend confident; Joe, observant)
“Sit down little boy, and have some hot tea. I bet you can’t pay for scotch anyway” said Joe pushing a cup of hot sweet tea over the counter. The boy took a long sip, another one, his shivering started fading away and his teeth stopped chattering. (Joe, welcoming/doubtful; Boy, relieved)
“I bet, you can’t pay for that tea as well”.
“I will pay for it as soon as I get a job, I will be an avatar driver.” Joe was clearly frustrated. “Oh boy, one more of those.”, he thought. “Go home to your mommy, and don’t show up here anymore. This is not a place for a 7 year old kid”, said Joe, “I don’t have either time or desire to deal with you”. (Joe, frustrated/impatient)
“I need a job”, answered the boy, “I won’t leave unless you give me the job. And I am 10 already, I am not a boy anymore.”
Oh yeah, being ten makes you a man, not under my watch, thought Joe. The only thought he had was how to get rid of this boy and get back to his job. He had to serve some drinks, check on the pods in the basement. He had work to do. “Ok, I’ll give you a test, and if you fail it, you will never show up at my bar again.” Joe took a square wood plank from the shelf and held it out for the child to grab. “Break it with your hand”. (Joe, annoyed/calculating; Boy, determined/cautious)
He didn’t move, with eyes focused on Joe He asked “I break this plank and I get a job?”. The kid was smart & cautious, maybe he will survive in this messed up world, though Joe. “Yes, you break it with your bare hands and you will get a job”. A little show for the patrons won’t hurt, and Joe will finally get rid of this boy when he fails the test. (Joe, calculating/expectant; Boy, cautious)
That board made a cracking sound… and didn’t break. Joe turned and started walking towards the bar, people started walking back to their tables, the boy looked shocked on his hands with damaged skin, drops of blood were forming on his knuckles, rolling down his fingers, and falling on the floor. Joe walked over the bar and turned to the boy to tell him to go home when he noticed that his finger curled back into a fist, and he hit the plank again, forcefully breathing out the air of his lungs. He hit again, and again, and again, until the wood couldn’t resist the force and broke into two pieces. (Boy, determined/shocked; Joe, surprised/relieved)
"You told me to break it, you didn’t tell me I can only hit it once. I have the job. Deal is a deal." (Boy, determined)
"Hey Joe. What the hell are you doing? This boy is what, 10 years old? And you will offer him a job? In the old world you would go straight to jail for this." (Swen, irritated)
"Shut your fucking mouth, Swen, and open your god damn eyes! This boy didn’t eat well for a month! He doesn’t have money. Will you feed him? Are you ready to buy him food and clothes and support him till he gets 14? Or do you think I should feed him? Or maybe you think I just should let him die? No? I don’t hear a fucking answer! You don’t have one? Then shut the fuck up and get lost." (Joe, angry)
"The Job is yours, Kid. But if you will fuck it up today, you will lose your chance. Let’s go and I will show you your pod for the day." (Joe, determined)
"I got the job!!! It was hard to describe emotions that filled me, joy, self-confidence, fear, but the most strong feeling of all was this indescribable understanding of me becoming a man today, I will support my family, I will bring money and food home, and everything will be fine. Now I need to keep focus and not fuck up." (Narrator, determined)
“Old time habits, Kid. Always scared that some party pooper will show up and we will need to stop our little business here.” (Joe, casual)
"That’s Mike, he is the top Overworld player in this shithole that I run, he even has a contract with some clan or something. But enough of it, the shift will start in 10 minutes, and we need to set up your pod." (Joe, casual)
"Can it break my bones?" (Narrator, fearful)
"Nah, it has enough safeguards, I heard about one or two cases tops, but haven’t seen anyone with my own eye yet. So it may be all just blabber." (Joe, casual)
"Will you adjust the size for me? It clearly looks too big for me." (Narrator, anxious)
"Ha, ha,... the size for you? It will take me at least couple days to adjust the size for you, and then back to another driver, I will lose 4 days of rental money. Will you pay for that? I doubt it. Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mi..." (Joe, amused)
"Will you adjust the size for me? It clearly looks too big for me." (Narrator, unsure)
"Ha, ha,... the size for you? It will take me at least couple days to adjust the size for you, and then back to another driver, I will lose 4 days of rental money. Will you pay for that? I doubt it. Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mike pays for. I doubt you will ever have money for this. And don’t fucking dare to mess up the work today. You owe me the rent for today, if you won’t get paid for your job, You will be fucking cleaning the floor in the bar with you damn cocky tongue for month." (Joe, angry)
"Yeah. I and all my family will die of hunger faster than that anyway, so I have nothing to lose." (Narrator, resigned)
"Don’t fuck it up kid, remember? Don’t fuck it up." (Joe, warning)
