"But me, I was so useless." (Narrator - self-critical)
"I didn’t know how to cook; I didn’t know how to wash clothes in the washer." (Narrator - helpless)

"I needed to get the job. My family wouldn’t survive much longer without money, and without me." (Narrator - concerned)
"The path through the city was so rough that my jacket and hoodie didn’t save me from the weather. After half an hour my shoes got wet, and at one hour in I stopped feeling my toes. I will definitely get sick, but not today, tomorrow. Today I will get the job." (Narrator - determined)
"But thank G.O.D. I didn’t meet either wild animals or gangs, they were not up and around this early in the morning, as there was no one to abuse or steal from." (Narrator - relieved)
"The city was abandoned and most of the buildings appeared to be in ruins, the virus outbreak nine and a half years ago, and everything that followed, killed ninety-nine percent of the population." (Narrator - somber)

"Swen. What the hell are you doing?" (Joe, irritated)
"Shut your fucking mouth, Swen, and open your god damn eyes! This boy didn’t eat well for a month! He doesn’t have money. Will you feed him? Are you ready to buy him food and clothes and support him till he gets 14? Or do you think I should feed him? Or maybe you think I just should let him die? No? I don’t hear a fucking answer! You don’t have one? Then shut the fuck up and get lost." (Joe, angry)

Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mike pays for. I doubt you will ever have money for this.
