"She’s just two years older than me, but not much taller, maybe one or two inches, just a tiny bit, and yet she already took over the caretakers’ responsibilities, who 
"A glass of scotch for me." (Young boy, scared)
"Sit down little boy, and have some hot tea. I bet you can’t pay for scotch anyway." (Joe, resigned)
"I will pay for it as soon as I get a job, I will be an avatar driver." (Young boy, determined)
"Go home to your mommy, and don’t show up here anymore. This is not a place for a 7 year old kid. I don’t have either time or desire to deal with you." (Joe, frustrated)
"I need a job. I won’t leave unless you give me the job. And I am 10 already, I am not a boy anymore." (Young boy, determined)
"Ok, I’ll give you a test, and if you fail it, you will never show up at my bar again." (Joe, skeptical)
"I break this plank and I get a job?" (Young boy, cautious)
"Yes, you break it with your bare hands and you will get a job." (Joe, smug)
"I have the job. Deal is a deal." (Boy, determined)
"Hey Joe. What the hell are you doing? This boy is what, 10 years old? And you will offer him a job? In the old world you would go straight to jail for this." (Swen, irritated)
"Shut your fucking mouth, Swen, and open your god damn eyes! This boy didn’t eat well for a month! He doesn’t have money. Will you feed him? Are you ready to buy him food and clothes and support him till he gets 14? Or do you think I should feed him? Or maybe you think I just should let him die? No? I don’t hear a fucking answer! You don’t have one? Then shut the fuck up and get lost." (Joe, angrily)
"The Job is yours, Kid. But if you will fuck it up today, you will lose your chance. Let’s go and I will show you your pod for the day." (Joe, stern)
"I got the job!!! It was hard to describe emotions that filled me, joy, self confidence, fear, but the most strong feeling of all was this indescribable understanding of me becoming a man today, I will support my family, I will bring money and food home, and everything will be fine. Now I need to keep focus and not fuck up." (Boy, determined)
“Old time habits, Kid. Always scared that some party pooper will show up and we will need to stop our little business here.” (Joe, casual)
"That’s Mike, he is the top Overworld player in this shithole that I run, he even has a contract with some clan or something. But enough of it, the shift will start in 10 minutes, and we need to set up your pod." (Joe, casual)
"Can it break my bones?" (Boy, fearful)
“Nah, it has enough safeguards, I heard about one or two cases tops, but haven’t seen anyone with my own eye yet. So it may be all just blabber.” (Joe, dismissive)
"Will you adjust the size for me? It clearly looks too big for me." (Boy, concerned)
"Ha, ha,... the size for you? It will take me at least couple days to adjust the size for you, and then back to another driver, I will lose 4 days of rental money. Will you pay for that? I doubt it. Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mi..." (Joe, amused)
"Will you adjust the size for me? It clearly looks too big for me." (Speaker: Unknown, Mood: Anxious)
"Ha, ha,... the size for you? It will take me at least couple days to adjust the size for you, and then back to another driver, I will lose 4 days of rental money. Will you pay for that? I doubt it. Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mike pays for. I doubt you will ever have money for this. And don’t fucking dare to mess up the work today. You owe me the rent for today, if you won’t get paid for your job, You will be fucking cleaning the floor in the bar with your damn cocky tongue for a month." (Speaker: Joe, Mood: Aggressive)
"Don't fuck it up kid, remember? Don't fuck it up." (Speaker: Joe, Mood: Stern)
