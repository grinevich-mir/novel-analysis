Here take some extenders from that shelf in the back. I only adjust pods for a long term booking, like the one Mike pays for. I doubt you will ever have money for this. And don’t fucking dare to mess up the work today. You owe me the rent for today, if you won’t get paid for your job, You will be fucking cleaning the floor in the bar with you damn cocky tongue for month." (Speaker: Joe, Mood: Angry)
